# No Thanks!

No Symfony, I'm using GitHub stars to "bookmark" repositories I'm interested in. I most certainly don't want to star every repository in my composer.json and their dependencies. Your reminder to install and run symfony/thanks is obtrusive, annoying and completely useless. Let's get rid of it.

## Installation

```
composer global require enumag/no-thanks
```
